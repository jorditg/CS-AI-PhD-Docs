\subsection{Entering text}
\textcolor{newcolor}{\bf Please note that Full Length Papers can have 7
pages (plus one page after revision) and Special Issue Papers can have
10 pages (plus one page after revision). The only exception is the
review article that is submitted to a Special Issue. These limits
include all materials e.g. narrative, figures, tables, references,
etc.}

\section{The first page}
Avoid using abbreviations in the title. Next, list all authors with
their first names or initials and surnames (in that order). Indicate
the author for correspondence (see elsarticle documentation).

Present addresses can be inserted as footnotes. After having listed all
authors' names, you should list their respective affiliations. Link
authors and affiliations using superscript lower case letters.

\subsection{The Abstract}
An Abstract is required for every paper; it should succinctly summarize
the reason for the work, the main findings, and the conclusions of the
study. The abstract should be no longer than 200 words. Do not include
artwork, tables, elaborate equations or references to other parts of
the paper or to the reference listing at the end. ``Comment'' papers
are exceptions, where the commented paper should be referenced in full
in the Abstract.

The reason is that the Abstract should be understandable in itself to
be suitable for storage in textual information retrieval systems.

\textit{Example of an abstract: A biometric sample collected in an
uncontrolled outdoor environment varies significantly from its
indoor version. Sample variations due to outdoor environmental
conditions degrade the performance of biometric systems that
otherwise perform well with indoor samples. In this study, we
quantitatively evaluate such performance degradation in the case
of a face and a voice biometric system. We also investigate how
elementary combination schemes involving min-max or z
normalization followed by the sum or max fusion rule can
improve performance of the multi-biometric system. We use
commercial biometric systems to collect face and voice samples
from the same subjects in an environment that closely mimics the
operational scenario. This realistic evaluation on a dataset of
116 subjects shows that the system performance degrades in
outdoor scenarios but by multimodal score fusion the
performance is enhanced by 20\%. We also find that max rule
fusion performs better than sum rule fusion on this dataset. More
interestingly, we see that by using multiple samples of the same
biometric modality, the performance of a unimodal system can
approach that of a multimodal system.}

\section{The main text}

Please divide your article into (numbered) sections (You can find the
information about the sections at
\url{http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/505619/authorinstructions}).
Ensure that all tables, figures and schemes are cited in the text in
numerical order. Trade names should have an initial capital letter, and
trademark protection should be acknowledged in the standard fashion,
using the superscripted characters for trademarks and registered
trademarks respectively. All measurements and data should be given in
SI units where possible, or other internationally accepted units.
Abbreviations should be used consistently throughout the text, and all
nonstandard abbreviations should be defined on first usage
\citep{vanderGeeretal2000}.

\subsection{Tables, figures and schemes}
Graphics and tables may be positioned as they should appear in the
final manuscript. Figures, Schemes, and Tables should be numbered.
Structures in schemes should also be numbered consecutively, for ease
of discussion and reference in the text. \textcolor{newcolor}{\bf
Figures should be maximum half a page size.}
All numbers and letters in figures and diagrams should be at least of
the same font size as that of the figure caption.

Depending on the
amount of detail, you can choose to display artwork in one column (20
pica wide) or across the page (42 pica wide). Scale your artwork in
your graphics program before incorporating it in your text. If the
artwork turns out to be too large or too small, resize it again in your
graphics program and re-import it. The text should not run along the
sides of any figure. This is an example for citation \citep{StrunkWhite1979}.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{prletfig01}
\caption{Studio setup for capturing face images indoor. Three light
sources L1, L2, L3 were used in conjunction with normal office lights.}
\end{figure}

You might find positioning your artwork within the text difficult
anyway. In that case you may choose to place all artwork at the end of
the text and insert a marker in the text at the desired place. In any
case, please keep in mind that the placement of artwork may vary
somewhat in relation to the page lay-out \citep{MettamAdams1999}.

This can easily be achieved using \verb+endfloat.sty+ package. Please
refer the following documentation to use this package.
\makeatletter
\if@twocolumn
\begin{verbatim}
  http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/
  endfloat/endfloat.pdf
\end{verbatim}
\else
\begin{verbatim}
  http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/endfloat.pdf
\end{verbatim}
\fi
\makeatother

\textcolor{newcolor}{\bf You should insert a caption for the figures
below the figures and for the tables the caption should be above the
tables.} 

Please remember that we will always also need highresolution versions
of your artwork for printing, submitted as separate files in standard
format (i.e. TIFF or EPS), not included in the text document. Before
preparing your artwork, please take a look at our Web page:
\url{http://www.elsevier.com/locate/authorartwork}.


\subsection{Lists}

For tabular summations that do not deserve to be presented as
a table, lists are often used. Lists may be either numbered or
bulleted. Below you see examples of both.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first entry in this list
\item The second entry
\begin{enumerate}
\item A subentry
\end{enumerate}
\item The last entry
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item A bulleted list item
\item Another one
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Conventionally, in mathematical equations, variables and
anything that represents a value appear in italics.
All equations should be numbered for easy referencing. The number
should appear at the right margin.
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm pg}'=\frac{S_{\rm pg}-\min(S_{\rm pG})}
 {\max(S_{\rm pG}-\min(S_{\rm pG})}
\end{equation}
In mathematical expressions in running text ``/'' should be used for
division (not a horizontal line). 

\section*{Acknowledgments}
Acknowledgments should be inserted at the end of the paper, before the
references, not as a footnote to the title. Use the unnumbered
Acknowledgements Head style for the Acknowledgments heading.

\section*{References}

Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in
the reference list (and vice versa).

\section*{\itshape Reference style}

Text: All citations in the text should refer to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Single author: the author's name (without initials, unless there
is ambiguity) and the year of publication;
\item Two authors: both authors' names and the year of publication;
\item Three or more authors: first author's name followed by `et al.'
and the year of publication.
\end{enumerate}
Citations may be made directly (or parenthetically). Groups of
references should be listed first alphabetically, then chronologically.

\bibliographystyle{model2-names}
\bibliography{refs}

\section*{Supplementary Material}

Supplementary material that may be helpful in the review process should
be prepared and provided as a separate electronic file. That file can
then be transformed into PDF format and submitted along with the
manuscript and graphic files to the appropriate editorial office.
